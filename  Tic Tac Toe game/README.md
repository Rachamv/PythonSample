# Tic Tac Toe game in Python

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game written in Python. The game is played on a 3x3 board, with each player taking turns placing their mark (X or O) on an empty space. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

The code is well-commented and easy to understand. It uses a few basic Python concepts, such as lists, loops, and conditionals. The game logic is also sound, and it is guaranteed to end in a winner (or a tie).

To play the game, simply run the `main.py` file. The game will then start, and you will be prompted to enter your moves. Once you have made your move, the board will be updated, and the game will check for a winner. If there is no winner, the game will continue until one player has three of their marks in a row.

I hope you enjoy playing this game!
