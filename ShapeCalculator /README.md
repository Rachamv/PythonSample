# Case Study: Geometry Tutor
Let's apply the Decomposition strategy to design a program.

Imagine you are asked to build a program to assist 7th grade students in understanding how to calculate area of various shapes.

The program should ask the user to enter a shape from a list, for example:

Rectangle
Circle
Triangle
Depending on the choice the user enters, it asks the user to enter the to calculate the area of the needed shape.
